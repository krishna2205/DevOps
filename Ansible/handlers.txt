What is Handlers in Ansible?
Handlers are just like normal tasks in an Ansible playbook but they run only when if the Task contains a “notify” directive. It also indicates that it changed something.

Let take a example, it is useful for secondary actions that might be required after running a Task. Such as installing a new nginx after installation then run the nginx in our remote machine.

Nginx.yml

- name: mukesh
  hosts: WORKSPACE
  tasks:
         - name: Install nginx
           package:
             name: nginx
             state: present
           notify:
                Start nginx
  handlers:
       - name: Start nginx
         service:
           name: nginx
           state: started
